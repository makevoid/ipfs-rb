# ipfs-rb-upload

### ipfs-rb

Using IPFS and `ipfs-ruby` gem to call ipfs and to upload one file (ipfs add is done by shelling out to bash at the moment)


Manual process of hash publishing using blockchainpen.com (funding the wallet, writing the message and publishing an op_return transaction)


notes: it would be great if/when ipfs will support multipart file upload
